### Templates

Because of micro services pattern I've been creating a lot of project recently, and I came to mind that even as fast I can copy the same codes in those new projects, I still need to test those codes to see if I didn't forget anything. 

Those templates have the minimum necessary to auxiliary the domain layer, in other words: infra, services, presentation and other layers around the domain layer. 

Feel free to send me some insights.

May the force be with you!

Copy those zip files on 'Zips' folder to C:\Users\@user\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates\ProjectTemplates and you're ready to go.
